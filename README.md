# K Means Clustering

An example of how I tackled k means clustering using python. This Python project implements the K-Means Clustering algorithm from scratch and visualizes clusters using matplotlib. It groups countries based on two numerical features (e.g., birthrate and life expectancy) extracted from the CSV files. Included is the code and my intepretations of the processed data.
